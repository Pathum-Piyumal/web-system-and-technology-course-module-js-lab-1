📘 Web Systems & Technologies – Lab Sheet 01
Working with Arrays and Objects in JavaScript

This repository contains solutions for Lab Sheet 01 of the course SE3106 – Web Systems & Technologies.
The tasks focus on JavaScript fundamentals including:

Arrays

Objects

Array methods (map, filter, reduce, etc.)

Nested arrays and objects

🚀 How to Run the Code
1. Install Node.js

Required to run JavaScript outside the browser.
Download from: https://nodejs.org

Check installation:

node -v

2. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>

3. Run the JavaScript file
node array.js

📝 Lab Solutions Overview
1. Arrays – Basics

Creating arrays

Accessing elements

Modifying elements (push, splice, length)

Looping using for and forEach

2. Array Methods

map() → transform data

filter() → select data

reduce() → aggregate data

Searching & sorting (includes, indexOf, sort)

3. Objects – Basics

Creating objects

Updating values

Adding new properties

Looping through object arrays

4. Nested Arrays & Objects

Array of objects

Object containing array of objects

Extracting data with loops, map, and filter

5. Challenge Activity

A list of products

Use reduce() to compute total inventory value

🧠 Reflection Answers
1. Difference between an array and an object?

Array: Ordered list, accessed by index

Object: Key–value pairs, accessed by property name

2. Why are arrays and objects often used together?

They allow us to represent real-world structured data such as students, products, courses, etc.

3. Most challenging part of this lab?

Understanding how higher-order methods like map, filter, and reduce manipulate data.
